## About Diarly
Diarly is a thoughtfully designed journaling application built for the modern user who values both privacy and a pleasant writing experience. It focuses on the practice of daily writing, providing a gentle, encouraging environment to capture your thoughts, gratitude, ideas, and memories each day. Unlike generic note-taking apps, Diarly is centered around the date, with each day offering a clean slate for a new entry, helping to build a consistent habit. All your data is encrypted locally on your device before being synced via iCloud, ensuring that your most personal writings remain for your eyes only.

The application strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and powerful organization. While the act of writing is straightforward, Diarly offers sophisticated tools to look back on your journey. The visual timeline and calendar heatmap show your writing activity at a glance, while search and tags help you track recurring themes or find specific moments. With native apps for Mac, iPhone, and iPad that sync seamlessly, your journal is always with you, ready for a quick reflection or a long writing session. It’s the ideal digital successor to the classic paper diary, enhanced with searchability, security, and multi-device access.
